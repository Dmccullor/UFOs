# UFO Sightings
A simple webpage which displays a set of data on UFO encounters
## Overview

This page features a table of data detailing UFO sightings from around the country. The site also features user-controlled filters for narrowing their search. The data can be filtered by date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFO in any combination.

## Results
Instead of clicking a button to initialize the filter, the user simply needs to type their condition into the appropriate filter prompt and press Enter. Once pressed, the table will reorder itself and only display results from the selected criteria. Here, the results have been filtered to only display the results in Texas.

Why stop with one? All of the filters can be used simultaneously, but keep in mind that the more of them are used at once, the less results will be produced, with some returning none at all. This image shows what will be displayed if the state is set to "tx" and the UFO shape is set to "light."

To revert to displaying data without a given filter, simply delete the filter entry and press Enter, or reload the page to reset completely.

## Summary
Although more customization is generally better, the scope of the filters may be too ambitious for the size of the data set. It is common to get no results with 3 or more filters applied. For the presentation of the page, it may be better to include only 3 filters. The "country" filter could be eliminated, as only 2 results are outside the US. The 2 outlying results are located in Canada.
